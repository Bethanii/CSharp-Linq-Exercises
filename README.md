## Overview
This repository contains a series of C# exercises using LINQ.

## Features
### Invoice Management
The first section includes an InvoiceMain class that showcases how LINQ can be used to manage a list of invoices. It demonstrates sorting invoices by part description and price, selecting specific fields and sorting by those, and filtering invoices within a specific price range. This example is beneficial for understanding how to manipulate complex data structures with LINQ.

### Duplicate Word Removal
In the DuplicateWordRemoval class, the code illustrates how to remove duplicate words from a sentence and display the unique words in alphabetical order. This example is useful for text processing and analytics tasks, showing how LINQ can simplify operations on strings and collections.

### Letter Sorting and Deduplication
The third section, represented by the program class, generates a list of random letters and then uses LINQ to sort them in ascending and descending order. It also demonstrates how to remove duplicate letters from the list. This example is great for understanding basic LINQ operations on lists, including sorting and deduplication.
